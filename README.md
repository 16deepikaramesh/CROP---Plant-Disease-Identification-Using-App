This repo is about how we can use the Deep Learning Models to detect and classify the diseases of plants and guide the farmers through videos and give instant remedies to overcome the loss of plants and fields.

***NOTE: I did it only for Tomato and Potato plants. you can do it for other plants by collecting data of that plant.***

## 1. The Cause And Introduction.
