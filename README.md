In this repo i’m going to explain how we can use the Deep Learning Models to detect and classify the diseases of plants and guide the farmers through videos and give instant remedies to overcome the loss of plants and fields. At first, we have to understand
1. What is the cause and how to overcome the cause?
2. What are the benefits of doing this ?
3. Can we solve this problem with “Deep Learning technology” ?
4. In Deep Learning “which Algorithm” is used to address this problem ? and how to do that ?.
